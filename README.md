WARNING: This project implements a malware for a UIUC Security Lab course (CS460).
Do not install.
Seriously.

For no particularly strong reason, I have chosen to name the virus Clementine.

For the sake of not distributing an answer key for the first CS242 project, I've omitted most of the ChessGame code.
The installer file is still included though, it is called directly from main.

Note that although there is a ClementineServer subsection, it does not implement FTP (which is required for the main server).
Furthermore, Clementine uses a hardcoded IP address that would need to be adjusted.

Assembling the virus is possible from these sources.
